In this tutorial, we are going to learn how we can make browser events come into action and how should we use them. An HTML event can be something the browser does or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

Here is a list of some common HTML events-

Onchange-  An HTML element has been changed
Onclick- The user clicks an HTML element
Onmouseover-   The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
Onmouseout-The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
Onkeydown- The user pushes a keyboard key
Onload- The browser has finished loading the page

Make a new file as tut57.html and add the boilerplate to get the HTML template. Then give the title as JS Events under the  tag. Let us now write some HTML to begin the work. We will simply add the paragraph and heading and the result will be as follows-

Now will make a button and we want to hide that button if someone clicks on it. But before that we can add some CSS to it to make it look attractive.

If we want that while clicking the button the paragraph should hide and by again clicking, it should come back, then we can write as follows-
